# SmartGPT
This repo contains a GPT network for LLM's generated from scratch on an OpenWebCorpus dataset of reddit comments and reviews.... The code is inspired and modified from Andrej Karpathy's explaination of how LLM's are made. Feel free to use the pretrained model or the code to train on your own dataset!
